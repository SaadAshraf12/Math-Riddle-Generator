{"description": "A meme showing 9 - 3 ÷ 1/3 + 1 = ?", "error": "Misinterpretation of division and order of operations", "explanation": "Correct calculation: 9 - 3 ÷ (1/3) + 1 = 9 - 9 + 1 = 1."}
{"description": "A social media post claiming that 0! = 0", "error": "Factorial miscalculation", "explanation": "0! (zero factorial) is defined as 1, not 0."}
{"description": "A meme stating that (-3)^2 = -9", "error": "Incorrect exponentiation", "explanation": "(-3)^2 means (-3) × (-3) = 9, not -9."}
{"description": "A post asserting that 1 + 1 = 3", "error": "Basic addition mistake", "explanation": "1 + 1 always equals 2, not 3."}
{"description": "A meme showing √9 = ±3", "error": "Misinterpretation of square roots", "explanation": "The principal square root of 9 is 3, not ±3. The equation x^2 = 9 has solutions x = ±3, but the square root function itself only returns the positive root."}
{"description": "A post claiming that the area of a circle is πd^2", "error": "Incorrect formula", "explanation": "The correct formula is A = πr^2, not πd^2."}
{"description": "A meme stating that 10% of 200 is 50", "error": "Percentage miscalculation", "explanation": "10% of 200 is 20, not 50."}
{"description": "A social media post claiming that 5 ÷ 0 = 5", "error": "Division by zero", "explanation": "Division by zero is undefined in mathematics."}
{"description": "A meme showing 2 + 3 × 4 = 20", "error": "Ignoring order of operations", "explanation": "Correct calculation: 2 + (3 × 4) = 2 + 12 = 14."}
{"description": "A post stating that x^0 = 0 for all x", "error": "Exponentiation mistake", "explanation": "Any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1, not 0."}
{"description": "A meme claiming that a triangle can have an angle sum of 360 degrees", "error": "Geometric misconception", "explanation": "The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, not 360."}
{"description": "A post asserting that (x + y)^3 = x^3 + y^3", "error": "Incorrect binomial expansion", "explanation": "The correct expansion is (x + y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3."}
{"description": "A meme showing 8 ÷ 4 × 2 = 1", "error": "Misinterpretation of division and multiplication", "explanation": "Correct calculation: 8 ÷ 4 × 2 = 2 × 2 = 4."}
{"description": "A social media post claiming that the cube root of 8 is ±2", "error": "Misunderstanding cube roots", "explanation": "The cube root of 8 is 2, not ±2. Cube roots have only one real value."}
{"description": "A meme stating that 1 - (-1) = 0", "error": "Basic arithmetic mistake", "explanation": "1 - (-1) equals 1 + 1 = 2, not 0."}
{"description": "A post claiming that an even number plus an even number equals an odd number", "error": "Parity rule mistake", "explanation": "The sum of two even numbers is always even."}
{"description": "A meme showing 5^2 + 5^2 = 10^2", "error": "Incorrect application of the Pythagorean theorem", "explanation": "5^2 + 5^2 = 50, not 100. The correct equation should be based on a right triangle, not arbitrary squaring."}
{"description": "A social media post claiming that 100% increase means multiplying by 100", "error": "Percentage increase miscalculation", "explanation": "A 100% increase means doubling the original value (multiplying by 2), not multiplying by 100."}
{"description": "A meme stating that log_10(1000) = 2", "error": "Logarithm miscalculation", "explanation": "log_10(1000) = 3, because 10^3 = 1000, not 10^2."}
{"description": "A post asserting that 3^(-2) = -9", "error": "Incorrect negative exponent calculation", "explanation": "3^(-2) means 1/(3^2) = 1/9, not -9."}
